      <!-- Project: GitHub Course Projects -->
      <article class="project-item">
        <h3>GitHub Course Projects</h3>
        <p>This GitHub repository showcases a wide range of individual and one collaborative project completed as part of my academic journey and professional development. The work spans disciplines including DevOps pipelines, advanced Python scripting, Java-based enterprise applications, and front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Projects reflect hands-on experience in server-side development with Java, JSP, and MySQL; DevOps practices such as version control, automation, and CI/CD concepts; and Python applications for data processing and system tasks. I’ve also contributed to front-end design with responsive layouts and JavaScript interactivity. My contributions involve writing and debugging code, implementing CRUD operations, managing repositories, and maintaining clear, standards-based documentation.</p>

      <!-- Project: State Management App -->
      <article class="project-item">
        <h3>State Management Web App</h3>
        <p>A server-side web application designed to demonstrate full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using JSP, JavaBeans, and a MySQL database. This project simulates a professional workflow for managing U.S. state records through a user-friendly, dynamic interface. All database operations are handled via a reusable JavaBean (<code>StateDAO.java</code>), promoting clean architecture and separation of concerns. The application reflects real-world web development practices with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and clarity.</p>
